### Overdue resource

If the user has insufficient funds, resources would be automatically suspended and retained for 5 days. During this period, users can top up to restore the resources. Otherwise the resources would be deleted and retained in the ¡°Recycle Bin¡± for 2 hours. After that, the resources would be completely removed and unable to be restored.

Please pay attention to system notices and timely top up your account to avoid any loss. Thank you for your understanding and cooperation.
