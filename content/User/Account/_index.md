### Account management guide

When registering users, stronger passwords are required to reduce cracking risks. After the registration is complete, users can log in to the console by using their email addresses and passwords. Users are advised to configure security policies based on their security requirements and usage habits to enhance account security. Currently, the following account security properties are supported:

Change the login password;

Enable the two-factor authentication in addition to the password;

Send SMS notifications in case of multiple failed login attempts with wrong password or wrong authentication code;

Disable session persistence on the browser, in other words, login information is not recorded when you exit the browser after temporary login.

For detailed account security settings, please refer to the Account Management Guide
